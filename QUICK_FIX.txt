## 🔧 Quick Fix Summary

### What Was Fixed
The education pathway field filter wasn't working - changing "Field of Interest" didn't change recommendations.

### Changes Made

#### 1️⃣ Education Dataset Enhancement
```
BEFORE: 5 columns (program_name, program_type, modality, budget, learning_style, motivation)
AFTER:  6 columns (added "field")

Now each program is tagged with its field category:
- Bachelor of Science in Computer Science → technology
- Master of Business Administration → business
- Bachelor of Science in Nursing → healthcare
- Bachelor of Fine Arts → creative
... etc for all 72 unique programs
```

#### 2️⃣ ML Model Update
```
OLD MODEL FEATURES:
["modality", "budget", "learning_style", "motivation"]

NEW MODEL FEATURES:
["modality", "budget", "learning_style", "motivation", "field"]
```

#### 3️⃣ Smarter Field Filtering
```javascript
// Before: String matching (unreliable)
if (any keyword in program_title):
    include_in_results

// After: Direct field matching (reliable)
if (program.field == selected_field):
    include_in_results
```

### To Apply the Fix

**Run this command:**
```bash
python retrain_education_model.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Load the updated education dataset with field information
- ✅ Retrain the ML model with the new feature
- ✅ Save model_education.pkl with field support
- ✅ All field selections will now work correctly

### Verification

After retraining, test it:
```
Form selections:
- Education Level: Bachelor's Degree
- Program Type: College
- Field of Interest: Creative Arts / Design
- Modality: Online

Expected Result:
✅ Shows: Fine Arts, Graphic Design, Fashion Design, Film Production
❌ Does NOT show: Nursing, Business Admin, Engineering
```

### Files Changed
1. `education_dataset.csv` - Added field column with 72 unique programs
2. `train_model.py` - Updated education model features
3. `app.py` - Improved filtering logic (line 521-536)
4. `retrain_education_model.py` - New script for easy retraining
